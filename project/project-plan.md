## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Socioeconomic Factors and Healthcare Burden during COVID-19 in the Americas
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How did socioeconomic factors (e.g., GDP per capita, healthcare expenditure) correlate with COVID-19 outcomes (e.g., mortality and ICU occupancy rates) in the Americas?

## Description
