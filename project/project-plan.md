## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Impact of COVID-19 on Healthcare Resource Burden and Socioeconomic Factors in the Americas
## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How did COVID-19 affect healthcare resource burdens across North and South America, and what is the correlation between socioeconomic factors and COVID-19-related healthcare pressures?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->

This project investigates the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare systems in North and South America, with a focus on the role of socioeconomic factors. By analyzing healthcare data alongside socioeconomic indicators, the study aims to identify patterns and correlations between socioeconomic conditions and healthcare burdens during the pandemic. The findings could help reveal disparities in healthcare capacity and response across countries, providing insights for targeted interventions in future health crises.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
